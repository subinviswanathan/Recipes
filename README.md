# Recipes
1.	Build a page that renders the data consumed from the following URL into a dynamically generated page ideally using either Jquery or any other frameworks like backbone etc.
2.	Use the json feed from : http://origin-www.tasteofhome.com/feed/msn-slideshows/
3.	This page should include standard styling via CSS ( generated from SASS)
o   Main Title should be H1
o   Abstract text
o   Author
o   Card
  Title H3
  Text


The url  http://origin-www.tasteofhome.com/feed/msn-slideshows/ was throwing error while parsing  so made a simple JSON store in myjson and hitting that url to get data


LIBRARIES USED IN THIS ARE JQUERY, BOOTSTRAP AND SLICK
